# Contract-IQ
Contract IQ-is a Python-based tool that helps users analyze and understand legal contracts using natural language processing (NLP). It’s designed for students, freelancers, and small business owners who often sign agreements but may not fully grasp the legal implications. The software will scan uploaded contracts (PDF or text), highlight key clauses (e.g., termination, payment terms, liability), and provide plain-English summaries and risk alerts.
Target Users:
College students signing internships, housing leases, or service agreements

Freelancers working with clients on short-term contracts

Small business owners reviewing vendor or partnership agreements
